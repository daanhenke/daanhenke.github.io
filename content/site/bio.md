My name is Daan, I'm 22 years old and I love low level programming and reverse engineering. I've been programming since I was 9 years old, I started out developing tiny games and eventually moved on to more general use programming languages as I got better at it.
I'm currently learning about hypervisors and their implementations while trying to create a stealthy extension for a popular proprietary hypervisor.

I'm also interested in frontend frameworks / static site generators. My favorite's right now are Svelte for tiny web applications and Vue / Nuxt for anything that deals with static content, like this website.
